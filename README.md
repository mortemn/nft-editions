- BPS Royalty: 500 = 5%, 1000 = 10%, so on and so forth, set to 0 for no on-chain royalty (not supported by all marketplaces)

### How do I sell/distribute editions?

Now that you have a edition, there are multiple options for lazy-minting and sales:

1. To sell editions for ETH you can call `setSalePrice`
2. To allow certain accounts to mint `setApprovedMinter(address, approved)`.
3. To mint yourself to a list of addresses you can call `mintEditions(addresses[])` to mint an edition to each address in the list.

### Benefits of these contracts:

* Full ownership of your own created minting contract
* Each serial gets its own minting contract
* Gas-optimized over creating individual NFTs
* Fully compatible with ERC721 marketplaces / auction houses / tools
* Supports tracking unique parts (edition 1 vs 24 may have different pricing implications) of editions
* Supports free public minting (by approving the 0x0 (zeroaddress) to mint)
* Supports smart-contract based minting (by approving the custom minting smart contract) using an interface.
* All metadata is stored/generated on-chain -- only image/video assets are stored off-chain
* Permissionless and open-source
* Simple integrated ethereum-based sales, can be easily extended with custom interface code

### Potential use cases for these contracts:

* Giveaways for events showing if youâ€™ve attended 
* Serial editioned artworks that can be sold in the Zora auction house / work in any ERC721 market
* Fundraisers for fixed-eth amounts
* Can be used to issue tokens in response for contributing to a fundraiser
* Tickets/access tokens allowing holders to access a discord or mint
